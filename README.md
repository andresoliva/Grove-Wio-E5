# Grove-Wio-E5 Basic example
Basic Arduino-coded example of SeedStudio module Grove-Wio-E5 based on chip STM32WLE5JC from STM.\
This example was made based on SeedStudio's original example (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_LoRa_E5_New_Version) with a few modifications in order to properly work with Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble-sense) board.
#### Notes:
  &emsp; -Tested with Arduino 1.8.x IDE.\
  &emsp; -Example fully works with LoRa Gateways.
#### Advanced example:
If you are interested in a more complex application or use of the Grove-Wio-E5 module, an advanced example version will be released in the following weeks in another repository.
## Hardware Setup:
This project uses the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board (it works with any of the revisions of this board)\
If you have a Grove shield (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/#how-to-connect-grove-to-your-board),
then just connect your Arduino Nano 33 BLE to the shield and then plug your Grove-Wio-E5 into the UART slot of the Shield\
If you don't have any Grove Shield, here is a picture of how to connect the board directly:
