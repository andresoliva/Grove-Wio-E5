# Grove-Wio-E5 Basic example
Basic Arduino coded example of SeedStudio module Grove-Wio-E5 based on chip STM32WLE5JC from STM. 
This example was made based on SeedStudio original example (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_LoRa_E5_New_Version) with a few modifications in order to properly work with Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble-sense) board.
#### Notes:
  &emsp; -Tested with Arduino 1.8.x IDE. \
  &emsp; -Example fully works with LoRa Gateways \
#### Advanced example:
If you are interested in a more advanced application or use of this module, an advanced example version will be released in the following weeks in another repository
