# Grove-Wio-E5 Basic example
Basic Arduino-coded example of Seed Studio module Grove Wio E5, which uses the system on chip STM32WLE5JC from STM.\
This example was made based on Seed Studio's original example (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_LoRa_E5_New_Version) with a few modifications in order to properly work with Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board (https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble-sense).
#### Notes:
  * Tested with Arduino 1.8.x IDE.
  * Example fully works with LoRa Gateways.
  * All the parts not mentioned in this current "README" goes as listed in the original Seed Studio's original example
#### Advanced example:
If you are interested in a more complex application or use of the Grove-Wio-E5 module, an advanced example version will be released in the following weeks in another repository.
## Hardware Setup:
This project uses the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board (it works with any of the revisions of this board)\
If you have a Grove shield (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/#how-to-connect-grove-to-your-board),
then connect your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to the shield and then plug your Grove-Wio-E5 into the UART slot of the Grove Shield\
If you don't have any Grove Shield, here is a picture of how to connect the board directly as shown:

## Software Codes:
In this project, there are two codes available:
  * Nano33BLE_Grove_LoRa: Same example as shown in the original Seed studio example ( https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_LoRa_E5_New_Version/#software-preparation) but compatible with Nano 33 BLE Sense and without the code related to the display.
  * Nano33BLE_Grove_LoRa_time_measures: This project features some modifications to the "Nano33BLE_Grove_LoRa" in order to allow the user to have a better understanding of the topic. Relevant additional features:
    + Disable all the messages printed to the user with the Serial (UART) port.
    + Measure and show the time it took to the Grove-Wio-E5 module to execute the commands sent and the time to get the ACK of the Gateway (if applicable, because some of the commands do not need a Gateway response).
    + Sends 12 bytes instead of 4. This was made to allow you to properly compare the time-on-Air of your sent message with tools that use this payload as a "standard" way to perform this calculation. See https://avbentem.github.io/airtime-calculator/ttn/eu868 (and the repository) for more information regarding this topic. Note: You can also still receive and decode the Temperature and Humidity values with the same code used for the  code used with the "Nano33BLE_Grove_LoRa" example.
    + Fixed the way the original example checks for proper command verifications.
## Gateway Interfacing:
Follow the steps as listed in https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_LoRa_E5_New_Version/#ttn-console-configuration-setup. Depending on the gateway, you may need to find for yourself where are located the different fields of the Gateway you need to set up in order to establish a connection between your Grove-Wio-E5 and Gateway. In my case, I ran this example with a Milesight UG65 Semi-Industrial LoRaWANÂ® Gateway, so what I did was first read the Seed Studio Example, then searched for an example used for the  Milesight Gateway and lately, after some struggling, I was able to make it work. Your node (which is the Nano 33 BLE Sense + Grove-LoRa-E5 in this case) should tell you in the terminal, as told in Seed's example if it was able to join the Network managed by the Gateway properly and the messages sent by your node has reached the Gateway.
